        <h2>Some notes about HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>When writing html, we should always keep in mind two types of tags: Paired and Singular.</p>
        <section>
        <h3>Examples of paired tags</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>The Paragraph tag</b></dt>
                 <dd>We use this tag when there is a block of text that we want to define as a paragraph. 
                     Having the text between the opening tag and the closing tag will systematically 
                     add a space before and after the content of the paragraph.</dd>
            <dt><b>The Emphasis tag</b></dt>
                    <dd>If you ever have words in your text that you want to slightly emphasize compared to the rest,
                        this would be the tag to use.</dd>
            <dt><b>The Html tag</b></dt>
            <dd>Probably the most important tag of all. It is mandatory that all the content added to the page is inside
                the opening and the closing html tags.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Examples of singular tags</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>The Line break tag</b></dt>
            <dd>This tag is used whenever it is important to create a division in lines. 
                It should never be used as a design tool in order to create more space.</dd>
            <dt><strong>The Horizontal line tag</strong></dt>
            <dd> It is used when there is a change of topic in the content. It creates a smooth transition
            from one aspect of the content to the other.</dd>
