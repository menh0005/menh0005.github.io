            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My first working experience was with a multinational advertising and public relations company, where I had the opportunitity to work with creative teams who introduced me to the world of <em>Digital marketing</em>, <em>Graphic design</em>, and <em>Video production</em>.<br>
                My goal now is to build on that experience and develop more skills through the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at <strong>Algonquin College</strong> to explore new opportunities.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I enjoyed the most about my job was meeting with my team, exploring new ideas and challenging each other to provide a better version of our work.
                I believe that creating an inclusive and positive work dynamics, in addition to mutual understanding is important to ensure success. Moreover, I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people and discovering new cultures.<br>Which is why I moved from Morocco to Canada on <strong>June 10<sup>th</sup> 2019</strong>.
