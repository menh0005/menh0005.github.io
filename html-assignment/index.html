                As a communication executive with two year's experience in advertising, I have had the opportunity to work with creative and design teams that introduced me to the world of digital marketing, graphic design and video production.<br>
                Foor this reason, I chose to enroll in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMG</abbr> program to develop more skills and explore new opportunities in the future.
