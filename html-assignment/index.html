            <h2>A <i>little bit</i> about me</h2>
            <p>
                My first working experience was with a multinational advertising and public relations company, where I had the opportunitity to work with creative teams that introduced me to the world of <b>Digital marketing</b>, <b>Graphic design</b>, and <b>Video production</b>.<br>
                My goal now is to build on that experience and develop more skills through the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to explore new opportunities.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I enjoyed the most about my job was meeting with my team, exploring new ideas and challenging each other to provide a better version of our work.<br>
                I believe that creating an inclusive and positive work dynamics, in addition to mutual understanding is important to ensure success. I am passionate about Branding, Creativity and Innovation.<br>
                Moreover, I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people and discovering Mew cultures.Which is why I moved from Morocco to Canada on <strong>June 10 <sup>th</sup> 2019</strong>.
