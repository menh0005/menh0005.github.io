                My first working experience was with a multinational advertising and public relations company, where I had the opportunitity to work with creative teams that introduced me to the world of <strong>Digital marketing</strong>, <strong>Graphic design</strong>, and <strong>Video production</strong>.<br>
                My goal now is to build on that experience and develop more skills through the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to explore new opportunities.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I enjoyed the most about my job was meeting with my team, exploring new ideas and challenging each other to provide a better version of our work.<br>
                I believe that creating an inclusive and positive work dynamics, in addition to mutual understanding is important to ensure success.
